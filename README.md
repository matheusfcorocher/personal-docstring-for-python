# personal-docstring-for-python

This repository contains examples like classes, methods, functions, tests, etc... of docstring for Python created by me. It was inspired by reading this websites:

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3898572/what-are-the-most-common-python-docstring-formats
- https://github.com/dadadel/pyment/blob/master/example.py
- https://www.betterspecs.org/

It only is a mixed of Google and Numpydoc. The docstring made is not a recommendation for using in your project, feel free to use or not.
